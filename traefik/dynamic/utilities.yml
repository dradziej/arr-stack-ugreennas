# Traefik routing for optional utilities
#
# NOTE: Most utilities are local-only (no Traefik routing) for security:
# - duc: No auth, exposes filesystem structure → http://NAS_IP:8838
# - uptime-kuma: Exposes infrastructure details → http://NAS_IP:3001
#
# Access these via local network or WireGuard VPN.
# Add routers here only for services that genuinely need remote access.
